# Start-Up Procedure
1. Press the **Service Retention** button found on the right-side wall of the cab.
   ![[TGV_ServRetCan.png]]
2. Hold the train auxiliary power button for at least 5 seconds (farthest to the left) - This acts like an APU in an aircraft until sustainable power is established.

3. Turn on the master switch. Now, the train is fed by the auxiliary power system.

4. Select Pantograph Mode (DC/AC/LGV). In Marseille, choose DC. Otherwise, it's LGV (AC is not included in the route at the time of this guide).
   ![[TGV_PanMode.png]]
5. Raise the pantograph (Normal). Now, the pantograph has contact with the wiring above the train.

6. Now that there is contact between the wire and the pantograph, close the train's circuit breaker to establish power to the train.

7. Now, re-arm the circuit breakers, allowing them to auto-open when overvoltage occurs.

8. Now, hold the brakes to ensure that the train does not move. The button should now illuminate.

9. Next, you need to **release the train brake** in order to *pressurize the main brake cylinder to the maximum* so that the train can safely unlock traction when attempting to depart.
   This type of brake uses air pressure accumulated in the cylinder to apply braking force on the wheels. If there is no accumulated air pressure, the train won't brake.
   Think of this as **Dynamic Brakes** that acts on all cars.

10. You can now disable brake hold. This will de-pressurize the related brake cylinder. This gauge indicates how much braking force is applied to the wheels by the brake hold system.
    Think of it as **Independent Brakes** that act on the control car only.

11. Set-up your driving mode (manual control/selected speed) and power handle controls to depart.
    ![[TGV_DrivingMode.png]]
    ![[TGV_PowerHandle.png]]
    In the case of using *selected speed* driving mode, you can adjust your cruise control speed via the **speed selector**.
    ![[TGV_SpeedSel.png]]
    The selected speed will then be displayed on this gauge below.

# Power Change-Over Procedure
When unsure when to apply the power change-over procedure, rely on your observation of train performance compared to potential performance. If the train is not operating at expected levels, it is possible that it is now time to switch to a different power mode. Apply the following procedures.
1. Power to idle.
   ![[TGV_PowerHandle.png]]
2. Circuit breakers OFF.
   ![[TGV_CircBrk.png]]
3. Circuit Breakers On.
   ![[TGV_CircBrk.png]]
4. Lower the pantograph.
   ![[TGV_PanSel.png]]
5. Change the pantograph mode.
   ![[TGV_PanMode.png]]
6. Wait until passing the REV board.
7. Raise the pantograph.
   ![[TGV_PanSel.png]]
8. Rearm the circuit breakers.
   ![[TGV_RearmCB.png]]
9. Add power.
